# Double-Pendulum-Analysis

This is a term project done at Dawson College. Its objective is to simulate the movement of a double pendulum in order to analyse its movements and its angles at every moment. It was made in Google colab, with Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. The Google Colab file is uploaded with the term project as a whole, and the code is uploaded one more time, alone, in a separate file. Here are some graphs that the relation between the movements and the angles of the double pendulum.
